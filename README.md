## Overview
This project explores how **Business Information Systems (BIS)**, **digital finance**, and **space/data-enabled technologies** can help agri-businesses in the **Shannon Basin** achieve **profitability**, **sustainability**, and **community resilience**—simultaneously.

---

## Problems
- Farmers in the Shannon Basin struggle to balance profitability, sustainability, and compliance with EU/Irish policies.  
- Traditional finance models don’t reward long-term impacts (e.g., biodiversity gains or carbon reduction).  
- Technology (BIS, IoT, satellite, finance platforms) exists but isn’t fully integrated or accessible for smallholders.

---

## Background Context
The **Shannon Basin** is a living laboratory of environmental, social, and economic activity. Agriculture is central to the region’s identity but faces pressures from:
- Climate change  
- EU Green Deal & CAP policy shifts  
- Market volatility  
- Rising sustainability and traceability demands  

Traditional financial systems often prioritize short-term profit, overlooking long-term benefits like **biodiversity**, **soil health**, and **community resilience**. Meanwhile, new opportunities in **BIS**, **digital finance**, and **space-enabled data** offer pathways to reimagine agri-business.

---

## Expected Outcomes
- **Integrated BIS framework** combining financial, environmental, and operational data (dashboards, KPIs, alerts).  
- **Alternative financing models** tailored to rural enterprises (green bonds, microfinance, carbon credits, co-ops).  
- **Demonstrable “alternative impacts”**, including:
  - Improved soil and water health  
  - Carbon reduction  
  - Biodiversity preservation  
  - Rural job creation  
- **Scalable models** transferable to other river basins and rural regions in Ireland and Europe.

---

## Scope
**Included**
- Business information systems  
- Agri-business models  
- Financial innovation  
- Sustainability impact measurement  
- Space/data-enabled technologies (e.g., satellite, IoT)

**Excluded**
- Large-scale industrial farming focused solely on yield maximization without sustainability goals

---

## Resource Pool
- Open datasets on **Shannon Basin** environment and land use  
- **EU CAP** and **EU Green Deal** policy documents  
- **TUS Works mentors**, **Shannon Studio networks**, and local stakeholder input  
- Examples of **BIS platforms** and **fintech solutions** in agriculture

## Problem → Opportunity Map
| Pain Point | Enabler | BIS/Tech Approach | Financing Angle | Impact Tracked |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Compliance complexity (EU/CAP) | Policy APIs, rule engines | Compliance checklists, automated alerts | Co-op shared advisory fund | % compliant acres, admin hours saved |
| Unrewarded long-term benefits | MRV tools (satellite/IoT) | Carbon & biodiversity MRV pipeline into dashboard | Carbon credits, green bonds | tCO₂e reduced, biodiversity index |
| Fragmented tech for smallholders | Low-cost IoT, mobile BIS | Plug-and-play data connectors; farmer-friendly UX | Microfinance, revenue-share models | Yield stability, input reduction |
| Water/soil health risks | Soil sensors, hydrology data | Risk scoring & early warnings | Resilience loans | Nitrate/phosphate levels, soil organic matter |
| Market volatility | Price feeds, co-op data | Scenario planning & hedging insights | Working-capital lines | Price variance, margin stability |

---

## Getting Started (Project Setup)
1. **Define KPIs**: Profitability, carbon, biodiversity, soil/water, jobs.  
2. **Data Architecture**: Ingest (IoT/satellite/finance), store (data lake/warehouse), model (ETL/ELT), visualize (BIS dashboards).  
3. **Pilot Cohort**: Select representative farms (size, practices, locations along the Basin).  
4. **Finance Pathways**: Match pilots to suitable instruments (credits, bonds, co-op pools).  
5. **MRV Workflow**: Establish Measurement/Reporting/Verification for impact claims.  
6. **Governance**: Set data ownership, consent, and sharing policies with stakeholders.

---

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1 — Discovery**: Stakeholder interviews, KPI design, dataset audit  
- **Phase 2 — Prototype**: Minimal BIS dashboard, 2–3 data connectors, initial MRV  
- **Phase 3 — Finance Integration**: Trial carbon credits/green microfinance with pilot farms  
- **Phase 4 — Evaluation**: Validate impacts, cost-benefit, farmer experience  
- **Phase 5 — Scale**: Replicate across the Basin; document transferability to other regions

---

## Success Metrics
- **Economic**: Margin per hectare, volatility reduction, working-capital efficiency  
- **Environmental**: tCO₂e avoided/sequestered; soil organic matter; water quality indicators; biodiversity scores  
- **Social**: Rural jobs created/sustained; training hours; co-op participation  
- **Adoption**: Number of farms onboarded; data connector uptime; dashboard engagement

---

## Stakeholders & Collaboration
- **Farmers & Co-ops** (primary users, data owners)  
- **Local Authorities & Agencies** (policy alignment, data access)  
- **Financiers** (credit unions, green funds, bond issuers)  
- **Academic & Tech Partners** (TUS Works, Shannon Studio, BIS/IoT providers)  
- **Community Groups & NGOs** (validation of social and ecological outcomes)
