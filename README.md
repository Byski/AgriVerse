## Overview
This project explores how **Business Information Systems (BIS)**, **digital finance**, and **space/data-enabled technologies** can help agri-businesses in the **Shannon Basin** achieve **profitability**, **sustainability**, and **community resilience**—simultaneously.

---

## Problems
- Farmers in the Shannon Basin struggle to balance profitability, sustainability, and compliance with EU/Irish policies.  
- Traditional finance models don’t reward long-term impacts (e.g., biodiversity gains or carbon reduction).  
- Technology (BIS, IoT, satellite, finance platforms) exists but isn’t fully integrated or accessible for smallholders.

---

## Background Context
The **Shannon Basin** is a living laboratory of environmental, social, and economic activity. Agriculture is central to the region’s identity but faces pressures from:
- Climate change  
- EU Green Deal & CAP policy shifts  
- Market volatility  
- Rising sustainability and traceability demands  

Traditional financial systems often prioritize short-term profit, overlooking long-term benefits like **biodiversity**, **soil health**, and **community resilience**. Meanwhile, new opportunities in **BIS**, **digital finance**, and **space-enabled data** offer pathways to reimagine agri-business.

---

## Expected Outcomes
- **Integrated BIS framework** combining financial, environmental, and operational data (dashboards, KPIs, alerts).  
- **Alternative financing models** tailored to rural enterprises (green bonds, microfinance, carbon credits, co-ops).  
- **Demonstrable “alternative impacts”**, including:
  - Improved soil and water health  
  - Carbon reduction  
  - Biodiversity preservation  
  - Rural job creation  
- **Scalable models** transferable to other river basins and rural regions in Ireland and Europe.

---

## Scope
